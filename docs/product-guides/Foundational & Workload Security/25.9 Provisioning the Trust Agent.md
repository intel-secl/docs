## Trust Agent Provisioning

"Provisioning" the Trust Agent involves connecting to a Verification
Service to download the Verification Service PrivacyCA certificate,
create a new Attestation Identity Keypair in the TPM, and verify or
create the TPM Endorsement Certificate and Endorsement Key. The
Verification Service PrivacyCA root certificate is used to sign the EC,
and the EC is used to generate the Attestation Identity Keypair. The AIK
is used by the Verification Service to verify the integrity of quotes
from the host’s TPM.  

Provisioning is the only time that the Trust Agent requires TPM ownership permissions.  If no TPM ownership secret is provided in the trustagent.env file, the Agent will use a null ownership secret to perform the provisioning steps.  If a TPM ownership secret is provided in the trustagent.env answer file, the Agent will attempt to use the specified secret.  If TPM ownership is in a clear state, the Agent will take ownership if a secret is specified.  If the TPM is already "owned," the Agent will try to use the specified secret; if the specified secret does not match the actual ownership password, the provisioning will fail.

Intel recommends using the default "null" ownership secret, as this makes it easy for other applications to also use the Trust Agent, and can prevent the need to clear ownership in the case of a need to re-provision.

Provisioning can be performed separately from installation (meaning you
can install the Trust Agent without Provisioning, and then Provision
later). If the `trustagent.env` answer file is present and has the
required Verification Service information during installation, the Agent
will automatically run the Provisioning steps.

???+ note 
    The `trustagent.env` answer file must contain user credentials for a user with sufficient privileges. The minimum role required for performing provisioning is the "AttestationRegister" role.

???+ note 
    If the Linux Trust Agent is installed without being Provisioned, the Trust Agent process will not actually run until the Provisioning step has been completed.

If the answer file is not present during installation, the Agent can be
provisioned later by adding the `trustagent.env` file and running the
following command:

`tagent setup -f <trustagent.env file
path>`



## Trust Agent Registration

Registration creates a host record with connectivity details and other
host information in the Verification Service database. This host record
will be used by the Verification Service to retrieve TPM attestation
quotes from the Trust Agent to generate an attestation report.

The Trust Agent can register the host with a Verification Service by
running the following command (the trustagent.env
answer file must be present in the current working directory):

`tagent setup create-host`

Hosts can also be registered using a REST API request to the
Verification Service:

```http
POST <https://verification.service.com:8443/hvs/v2/hosts>

{
    "host_name": "<hostname of host to be registered>"
    "connection_string": "intel:https://<hostname or IP address>:1443",
    "flavorgroup_names": [],
    "description": "<description>"
}
```

???+ note 
    When a new host is registered, the Verification Service will automatically attempt to match the host to appropriate Flavors. If appropriate Flavors are not found, the host will still be registered, but will be in an Untrusted state until/unless appropriate Flavors are added to the Verification Service.

## Importing the HOST\_UNIQUE Flavor

RHEL and VMWare ESXi hosts have measured components that are unique to
each host. This means that a special HOST\_UNIQUE flavor part needs to
be imported for each RHEL and ESXi host, in addition to any other OS or
Platform Flavors.

???+ note 
    Importing a Flavor requires user credentials for a user with sufficient privileges. The minimum role required for creating the HOST\_UNIQUE Flavor part is the “host\_unique\_flavor\_creator” role. This role can only create HOST\_UNIQUE Flavor parts, and cannot create any other Flavors.

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts with the Trust Agent, this can be
performed from the Trust Agent command line (this requires the
trustagent.env answer file to be present in the current working
directory):

```shell
tagent setup create-host-unique-flavor
```

This can also be performed using a REST API (required for VMWare ESXi
hosts):

```http
POST https://verification.service.com:8443/hvs/v2/flavors

{
	"connection_string": "<Connection string>",
	"partial_flavor_types": ["HOST_UNIQUE"]
}
```
