## Installing the Workload Agent

### Required For

-   Workload Confidentiality (both VMs and Containers)

### Supported Operating Systems

The Intel® Security Libraries Workload Agent supports:

* Red Hat Enterprise

* Linux 8.2

### Prerequisites

The following must be completed before installing the Workload Agent:

-   Intel® SecL Trust Agent installed and active.

-   cryptsetup

-   (REQUIRED for Virtual Machine Confidentiality only):

-   QEMU/KVM must be installed

-   libvirt must be installed


### Installation

* Copy the Workload Agent installation binary to the /root/ directory

* Verify that the `trustagent.env` answer file is present. This file was
  necessary for installing/provisioning the Trust Agent. Note that the
  additional content required for Workload Confidentiality with either
  VM Encryption or Container Encryption must be included in the
  `trustagent.env` file (samples provided in the previous section) for
  use by the Workload Agent.

* Execute the Workload Agent installer binary.

  ```shell
  ./workload-agent-v4.1.bin
  ```

* Reboot the server. The Workload Agent populates files that are
  needed for the default `SOFTWARE` Flavor, and a reboot is required for
  those measurements to happen.
