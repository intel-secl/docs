## Directory Layout

The Linux Trust Agent installs by default to `/opt/trustagent`, with the
following subfolders:

#### Bin

Contains executables and scripts.

#### Configuration

Contains the `config.yml` configuration file, as well as certificates and
keystores. This includes the AIK public key blob after provitioning.

#### Var

Contains information gathered from the platform and SOFTWARE Flavor
manifests. All files with the name `manifest_*.xml` will be parsed to
define measurements during boot. Generally these should be automatically
provisioned from the Verification Service when creating/deploying
SOFTWARE Flavors.
