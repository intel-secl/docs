## Directory Layout

The Linux Trust Agent installs by default to `/etc/trustagent`, with the
following subfolders:

#### v5.0.0

Contains the `config.yml` configuration file, as well as certificates and
keystores. This includes the AIK public key blob after provitioning.

#### cacerts

Contains ca certificate file generated from CMS.
