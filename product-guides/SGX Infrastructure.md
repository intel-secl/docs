## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Overview

The SGX Attestation infrastructure and Secure Key Caching (SKC) are part of the Intel Security Libraries for datacenter (ISecL-DC). Intel Security Libraries for Datacenter is a collection of software applications and development libraries intended to help turn Intel platform security features into real-world security use cases.

The SGX Attestation infrastructure provides an end to end support for registering SGX hosts and provisioning them with SGX material (PCK certificates) and SGX collateral (security patches information - TCB Information - and Certificate Revocation Lists - CRLs).

The SGX Attestation infrastructure also provides support for generating SGX quotes for SGX enclaves hosted by workloads and verifying them by a remote attesting application. The remote attesting application can also use the SGX Attestation infrastructure to enforce enclave policies (like requiring a specific enclave signer). Optionally, the SGX Attestation Infrastructure allows to integrate with Cloud Orchestrators like Openstack and Kubernetes.

SKC leverages the SGX Attestation Infrastructure to support the Secure Key Caching (SKC) use case.SKC provides the key protection at rest and in-use use case using the Intel Software Guard Extensions technology (SGX). SGX implements the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) paradigm.

Using the SKC Client -- a set of libraries -- applications can retrieve keys from the ISecL-DC Key Broker Service (KBS) and load them to an SGX-protected memory (called SGX enclave) in the application memory space. KBS performs the SGX enclave attestation to ensure that the application will store the keys in a genuine SGX enclave. Application keys are wrapped with an enclave public key by KBS prior to transferring to the application enclave. Consequently, application keys are protected from infrastructure admins, malicious applications and compromised HW/BIOS/OS/VMM. SKC does not require the refactoring of the application because it supports a standard PKCS\#11 interface.

## Trusted Execution Environment

A Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) provides a computer secure area where code and data can be loaded with the assurance that their confidentiality and integrity are protected. TEEs have various applications in areas where the confidentiality of the data and the integrity of the code are of the highest importance. One examples of a TEE usage is the protection of sensitive secrets like cryptographic keys and authentication strings. These secrets can be preserved within a TEE, ensuring that they never get exposed to software that is outside of the TEE. Operations involving these secrets can be performed within the TEE, removing the need to ever extract the secrets outside of the TEE. Another example is the processing of data with privacy concerns. This is often the case in financial, healthcare and artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Putting sensitive operations inside a TEE allows organizations to support business processes without compromising the privacy expectations of their customers.

### Intel Software Guard Extensions

Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) is an Intel platform security feature that implements the TEE paradigm. A portion of RAM called EPC (Enclave Page Cache) is used by applications to load secure isolated areas called SGX enclaves. Code and data inside SGX enclaves are encrypted and only decrypted inside the Intel CPU. From the host application perspective, an SGX enclave looks like a dynamic library. Any part of the application that is not contained in an SGX enclave is considered untrusted while the SGX enclave is considered trusted. Communications between the untrusted part and the trusted part (the SGX enclave) of an application uses a special calls called ECALLS and call from the enclave to the untrusted part of the application use OCALLS. A signed claim called SGX quote can be generated for an enclave. The SGX quote may contain a measurement of the code and the data of the enclave. An SGX quote allows to prove to a remote verifier (relying party) that an application includes the expected SGX enclave.

#### SGX ECDSA Attestation

SGX ECDSA attestation is the process that allows an application (relying party) to verify that a remote piece of code and data that it's interacting with is contained in a genuine Intel SGX enclave. The remote enclave can generate a signed claim called an SGX quote. A valid SGX quote signature generated on an SGX enabled platform can be chained up to a trusted Intel signing key. The SGX quote contains the measurement of the enclave (MREnclave), the enclave developer's signature (MRSigner), the security patch level of the platform (Trusted Computing Base or TCB) and any user data that the enclave wants to include in the quote. Typically, the user data in an SGX quote contains the hash of the public key part of a public/private key pair generated inside the enclave. The public key is transferred along with the SGX quote to the relying party. The latter generates a Symmetric Wrapping Key (SWK) and wraps it with the public key of the enclave. The wrapped SWK is provisioned into the SGX enclave, which can unwrap it since it has the corresponding private key. The relying party can then provision secrets into the SGX enclave after wrapping them with the SWK. For an enclave to generate an SGX quote, a PCK certificate for the host platform must be obtained from Intel SGX Provisioning Certification Service (PCS).

#### PCK Certificates Provisioning

To generate an SGX quote for an enclave, a PCK certificate must be obtained from SGX Provisioning Certification Service (PCS). Requiring a workload to retrieve the PCK certificate from Intel PCS at the time of the SGX quote generation can be detrimental to the workload. Network connectivity issues can prevent the connection to Intel PCS. To remove the dependency on network connectivity, the PCK certificates of the data center platforms are fetched before running any workload. This is achieved by extracting SGX related information from the platform using the PCK ID Retrieval tool and pushing it to a Caching Service running in the same data center. The Caching Service then retrieves the PCK certificates of all the platforms that pushed SGX information to it from Intel PCS. Network connectivity issues are not a problem since the Caching Service can retry if needed. When an SGX workload needs its PCK certificate, it can just get it from the Caching Service.

## Key Protection

Cryptographic keys are high value assets that must be protected against disclosure and corruption. Key disclosure or corruption expose the key owner to data confidentiality breaches, impersonation and denial of service. The industry has good solutions to protect keys at rest.

A popular solution is to store keys in a central secure Key Management System (KMS), and applications retrieve them at runtime. However, this solution does not protect keys once they are in RAM and used to perform cryptographic operations. Keys in RAM can be disclosed because of software vulnerabilities like Heartbleed or because of memory snapshots. Therefore, keys are not protected in use. This concern can be addressed by having the application send the payload that needs cryptographic processing to the KMS where the processing happens instead. By doing this, the key is never exposed in RAM. However, this solution incurs an overhead caused by the network round trip to the KMS.

Another solution is to store keys in Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)

### HSM

A Hardware Security Module or HSM is a separate hardware part that can be attached to a server. HSMs provide APIs to create and load keys. HSMs also support APIs to perform cryptographic operations using keys stored inside them. The typical flow for using an HSM is to create or load a key in the HSM in a secure environment then take the HSM to the server where the workload runs and attach it to this server. The application then performs cryptographic operations using the key inside the HSM. This ensures that the key is never exposed in RAM. Therefore, HSMs protect keys both at rest and in-use. The drawback with HSMs is that they can be a costly hardware add-on to the server, and they require physical access to the server to get attached to it (via the USB port for example).

Most HSMs support the PKCS\#11 cryptographic programming interface.

### PKCS\#11

PKCS\#11 is the standard cryptographic programming interface supported by HSMs. The PKCS\#11 interface is defined using a C-style definition, but many languages support bindings exist. Although applications can directly use the PKCS\#11 programming interface, most applications use other cryptographic interfaces like openssl. Fortunately, openssl supports a PKCS\#11 engine mechanism that converts openssl calls to PKCS\#11calls. This allows applications written against the openssl cryptographic interface to use an HSM supporting the PKCS\#11 interface without code change. Popular applications that use openssl but can still use an HSM to protect the key include Nginx and Apache.

## Features

### SGX Attestation Infrastructure

The SGX Attestation Infrastructure allows to fetch PCK certificates and SGX collateral from Intel SGX Provisioning Certification Service (PCS). It makes the PCK certificates available to workloads that use the SKC Client, which allows them to generate SGX quotes. The SGX Attestation Infrastructure also includes components that perform the verification of SGX quotes.

### SGX Support in Orchestrators

The SGX Attestation Infrastructure can optionally push the SGX information on compute nodes to cloud orchestrators so that SGX workloads (like SKC) can be scheduled on compute nodes that support SGX. Currently, the Kubernetes and Openstack orchestrators are supported.

### Key Protection

SKC leverages the SGX Attestation Infrastructure to protect keys in an SGX enclave at rest and in use. Applications use the SKC Client -- a set of libraries -- to retrieves keys at runtime from KBS. KBS performs an SGX enclave attestation. If the attestation is successful, KBS generates a Symmetric Wrapping Key (SWK), wraps it with the enclave public key and provisions it into the enclave, which can unwrap it since it has the corresponding private key. Application can then be provisioned into the SGX enclave after being wrapped with the SWK. Application keys are therefore never exposed to any software outside of the enclave.

# SGX Attestation Infrastructure and SKC Components

The components documented in this section are used by the SGX Attestation Infrastructure and therefore by SKC, which leverages the SGX Attestation Infrastructure. Components that are exclusively used by SKC have (SKC Only) in the corresponding sub-section title.

## Certificate Management Service

All the certificates used by SKC services and by the SGX Agent are issued by the Certificate Management Service (CMS). CMS has a root CA certificate and all the SKC services and the SGX Agent certificates chain up to the CMS root CA.

CMS is an infrastructure service and is shared with other Intel® SecL-DC components.

## Authentication and Authorization Service

The authentication and authorization for all SKC services and the SGX Agent are centrally managed by the Authentication and Authorization Service (AAS).

AAS is an infrastructure service and is shared with other Intel® SecL-DC components.

## SGX Caching Service

The SGX Caching Service (SCS) allows to retrieve the PCK certificates of the data center server platforms from Intel SGX Provisioning Certification Service (PCS). SCS retrieves also platform models collateral. The collateral consists of the security patches (TCBInfo) that have been issued for Intel platform models. Finally, SCS retrieves the Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).

Since the Caching Service stores all the TCBInfo of all the platform models in the datacenter, the SGX Quote Verification Service (SQVS) uses it to determine the TCB status of the platforms in the data center.

The SKC Client retrieves its PCK certificate from the Caching Service when it generates an SGX quote.

SCS can be deployed in both Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and tenant environments. In the CSP environment, SCS is used to fetch PCK certificates for compute nodes in the data center. In the tenant environment, it's used to cache SGX collateral information used in verifying SGX quotes.

## SGX Host Verification Service

If SGX Host Verification Service API URL is specified in SGX Agent env file, then SGX Agent will push the platform enablement info and TCB status to SHVS at regular interval, else, Agent pushes the platform enablement info and TCB status to SHVS periodically. The SGX enablement information consists of SGX discovery information (SGX supported, SGX enabled, FLC enabled and EPC memory size).

## SGX Agent

The SGX Agent resides on physical servers and pushes SGX platform specific values to SGX Caching Service (SCS).

If SGX Host Verification Service (SHVS) URL is specified in SGX Agent env file, SGX Agent would fetch the TCB status from SCS and updates SHVS with platform enablement info and TCB status periodically.

## Integration Hub

The Integration Hub (IHUB) allows to support SGX in Kubernetes and Open stack. IHUB pulls the list of hosts details from Kubernetes and then using the host information it pulls the SGX Data from SGX Host Verification Service and pushes it to Kubernetes. IHUB performs these steps on a regular basis so that the most recent SGX information about nodes is reflected in Kubernetes and Openstack. This integration allows Kubernetes and Openstack to schedule VMs and containers that need to run SGX workloads on compute nodes that support SGX. The SGX data that IHUB pushes to Kubernetes consists of SGX enabled/disabled, SGX supported/not supported, FLC enabled/not enabled, EPC memory size, TCB status up to date/not up to date and platform-data expiry time.

## Key Broker Service (SKC Only)

The Key Broker Service (KBS) is typically deployed in the tenant environment, not the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) environment. KBS is effectively a policy compliance engine. Its job is to manage key transfer requests from SKC Clients, releasing keys only to those that meet policy requirements. A user admin can create and register keys in KBS. He can also create key policies and assign them to keys. A key policy specifies the conditions that the SKC Client must fulfill for keys that have the policy assigned to them to be released. Most of the information about an SKC Client is contained in the SGX quote that it sends to KBS. The SGX quote also contains a hash of the enclave's public key. KBS gets the public key along the quote so the hash in the quote allows to verify that the public key is genuine. If the SGX quote verification (attestation) is successful, KBS generates a Symmetric Wrapping Key (SWK), wraps it with the enclave public key and provisions it into the enclave, which can unwrap it since it has the corresponding private key. Application can then be provisioned into the SGX enclave after being wrapped with the SWK. Application keys are therefore never exposed to any software outside of the enclave.

KBS is shared with other Intel® SecL-DC components.

## SGX Quote Verification Service

The SGX Quote Verification Service (SQVS) is typically deployed in the tenant environment, not the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) environment. SQVS performs the verification of SGX quotes on behalf of KBS. SQVS determines if the SGX quote signature is valid. It also determines if the SGX quote has been generated on a platform that is up to date on security patches (TCB). For the latter, SQVS uses the SGX Caching Service, which caches the SGX collateral information about Intel platform models. SQVS also parses the SGX quote and extracts the entities and returns them to KBS, which can then make additional policy decisions based on the values of the theses entities.

## The Workload SGX Dependencies

This is a set of dependencies needed by SGX workloads.

## The SKC Client (Secure Key Caching Use case Only)

The SKC Client refers to a suite of libraries that applications that require key protection must link with. It's comprised of the SKC Library, which is an Intel® SecL-DC component and the Intel Crypto Toolkit. the SKC Client uses the workload SGX dependencies component.  The SKC Library supports the PKCS\#11 interface and is therefore considered as a PKCS\#11 module from the host application perspective. The SKC Library uses Intel Crypto Toolkit to protect keys in an SGX enclave. When a key is requested by the host application, the SKC Library sends a request to the Key Broker Service (KBS) along with an SGX quote that is generated by the Crypto Toolkit. KBS releases the key after verifying the quote and evaluating the attributes contained in the quote. The key policy can also specify conditions that can't be verified with the SGX quote alone.

The SKC Client is typically deployed inside a tenant VM or container. It can also be used on bare metal. In all these deployments, the underlying platform is typically owned by a Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and is considered untrusted.

# Architecture Overview

As indicated in the Features section, SKC provides 3 features essentially:

-   SGX Attestation Support: this is the feature that CSPs provide to tenants who need to run SGX workloads that require attestation.
-   SGX Support  in Orchestrators: this feature allows to discover SGX support in physical servers and related information:
    -   SGX supported.

    -   SGX enabled.

    -   Size of RAM reserved for SGX. It's called Enclave Page Cache (EPC).

    -   Flexible Launch Control enabled.
-   Key Protection: this is the feature used by tenants using a CSP to run workloads with key protection requirements.

The high-level architectures of these features are presented in the next sub-sections.

## SGX Attestation Support and SGX Support in Orchestrators

The diagram below shows the infrastructure that CSPs need to deploy to support SGX attestation and optionally, integration with orchestrators (Kubernetes and OpenStack).

THE SGX Agent pushes platform information to SGX Caching Service (SCS), which uses it to get the PCK Certificate and other SGX collateral from the Intel SGX Provisioning Certification Service (PCS) and caches them locally. When a workload on the platform needs to generate an SGX Quote, it retrieves the PCK Certificate of the platform from SCS.

If SGX Host Verification Service (SHVS) URL is configured, the SGX Agent fetches the TCB Status from SCS and updates SHVS with SGX platform enablement information and TCB status periodically. The platform information is made available to Kubernetes and Openstack via the SGX Hub (IHUB), which pulls it from SHVS.

The SGX Quote Verification Service (SQVS) allows attesting applications to verify SGX quotes and extract the SGX quote attributes to verify compliance with a user-defined SGX enclave policy. SQVS uses the SGX Caching Service to retrieve SGX collateral needed to verify SGX quotes from the Intel SGX Provisioning Certification Service (PCS). SQVS typically runs in the attesting application owner network environment. Typically, a separate instance of the SGX Caching Service is setup in the attesting application owner network environment.

![](Images/image-20200727163158892.png)

The SGX Agent and the SGX services integrate with the Authentication and Authorization Service (AAS) and the Certificate Management Service (CMS). AAS and CMS are not represented on the diagram for clarity.

##  Key Protection

Key Protection leverages the SGX Attestation support and optionally, the SGX support in orchestrators.

Key Protection is implemented by the SKC Client -- a set of libraries - which must be linked with a tenant workload, like Nginx, deployed in a CSP environment and the Key Broker Service (KBS) deployed in the tenant's enterprise environment. The SKC Client retrieves the keys needed by the workload from KBS after proving that the key can be protected in an SGX enclave as shown in the diagram below.

![](Images/image-20200727163116765.png)

Step 6 is optional (keys can be stored in KBS). Keys policies in step 2 are called Key Transfer Policies and are created by an Admin and assigned to Application keys.

##  SKC Virtualization (Supported only on RHEL 8.2, not supported on Ubuntu 18.04)

Virtualization enabled on SGX Host machines, uses SGX key features. With Virtualization being enabled on SGX host, SKC Library which uses Intel crypto tool kit to protect keys in SGX Enclave can be configured on Virtual Machines which are created on SGX Hosts. This enhancement further provides the privilege for a workload on a VM  allowing successful Secure Key transfer flow which meets the policy requirements. Hence virtualization on SGX Hosts supports key transfer flow for Workload on bare metal, Workload inside a VM, Workload in a container and Workload in a container inside a VM enabled on SGX Host.

## Hardware Considerations

### Supported **Hardware**

-   Intel® Xeon® SP products those support SGX

### BIOS Requirements

-   Intel® SGX-TEM BIOS requirements are outlined in the latest Intel® SGX Platforms BIOS Writer's Guide

-   Intel® SGX should be enabled in BIOS menu (Intel® SGX is Disabled by default on Ice Lake).

-   Intel® SGX BIOS requirements include exposing Flexible Launch Control menu.


### OS Requirements (Intel® SGX does not supported on 32-bit OS):

-   Linux: RHEL 8.2

-   Linux: Ubuntu 18.04

### Requirements for Containerized Deployment with K8s

#### Operating System:

* RHEL 8.2
* Ubuntu 18.04

#### Kubernetes

* Single-node: `microk8s` (1.17.17)
* Multi-node: `kubeadm` (1.17.17)

#### Container Runtime

* Docker 19.03.13 on RHEL 8.2
* Docker 19.03.5 on Ubuntu 18.04

#### Storage:

* `hostPath` for Single Node `microk8s` for all services and agents
* `NFS` for Multi Node `kubeadm` for all services, `hostPath ` for sgx_agent and skc_library

##  Recommended Service Layout

The Intel® SecL-DC services can be installed in a variety of layouts, partially depending on the use cases desired and the OS of the server(s) to be protected. In general, the Intel® SecL-DC applications can be divided into management services that are deployed on the network on the management plane, and host or node components that must be installed on each protected server.

Management services can typically be deployed anywhere with network access to all the protected servers. This could be a set of individual VMs per service; containers; or all installed on a single physical or virtual machine.

Node components must be installed on each protected physical server.

Typically, this is needed for Linux deployments.

For a POC environment, all the management services can be installed on a single machine or VM.

This Includes:

-   Certificate Management Service (CMS)

-   Authentication and Authorization Service (AAS)

-   SGX Caching Service (SCS)

-   SGX Host Verification Service (SHVS)

-   Integration HUB (IHUB)

-   Key Broker Service (KBS) with backend key management

-   SGX Quote Verification Service (SQVS)

SGX Agent & SKC Library needs to be installed on SGX Enabled Machine.

Isecl-K8s-extensions must be installed on separate VM.

## Recommended Service Layout & Architecture - Containerized Deployment with K8s

The containerized deployment makes use of Kubernetes orchestrator for single node and multi node deployments. The supported deployment models are as below:

**Single Node:**

![k8s-single-node](./Images/k8s-single-node.png)


**Multi Node:**

![K8s Deployment-sqx](./Images/k8s-deployment-sgx.jpg)



**Services Deployments & Agent DaemonSets:**

Every service including databases will be deployed as separate K8s deployment with 1 replica, i.e(1 pod per deployment). Each deployment will be further exposed through k8s service and also will be having corresponding Persistent Volume Claims(PV) for configuration and log directories and mounted on persistent storage. In case of daemonsets/agents, the configuration and log directories will be mounted on respective Baremetal worker nodes.

![Each pod consist of only one container with service](./Images/pod-deployment.jpg)

For stateful services which requires database like shvs, aas, scs, A separate database deployment will be created for each of such services. The data present on the database deployment will also made to persist on a NFS, through K8s persistent storage mechanism

![database deployment](./Images/shvs-db.jpg)



**Networking within the Cluster:**

![Networking within cluster](./Images/within-cluster-communication-sgx.jpg)


**Networking Outside the Cluster:**

![Networking outside cluster](./Images/inter-cluster-communication-sgx.jpg)

**SKC Virtualization:**

![](.\Images\sgx-virtualization-model.jpg)

Follow the [Installation of Containerized Services and Agent in K8s Cluster](#Installation of Containerized Services and Agent in K8s Cluster) for installation instructions once deployment model is chosen

### Using the provided Database Installation Script

Install a sample Postgresql 11 database using the install_pgdb.sh script provided in binaries directory. This script will automatically install the Postgresql database and client packages required.

Create the iseclpgdb.env answer file:

ISECL_PGDB_IP_INTERFACES=localhost

ISECL_PGDB_PORT=5432

ISECL_PGDB_SAVE_DB_INSTALL_LOG=true

ISECL_PGDB_CERT_DNS=localhost

ISECL_PGDB_CERT_IP=127.0.0.1

Note that the values above assume that the database will be accessed locally. If the database server will be external to the Intel® SecL services, change these values to the hostname or FQDN and IP address where the client will access the database server.

### Provisioning the Database

Each Intel® SecL service that uses a database (the Authentication and Authorization Service, the SGX host Verification Service, the SGX caching Service,) requires its own schema and access. The database must be created and initialized. Execute the install_pgdb.sh script to install the database.

If a single shared database server will be used for each Intel® SecL service (for example, if all management plane services will be installed on a single VM), run install_pgdb.sh script only once and create_db.sh script for each component that uses a database.

If separate database servers will be used (for example, if the management plane services will reside on separate systems and will use their own local database servers), execute the install_pgdb.sh script on each server hosting a database and create_db.sh script for each component that uses a DB.

Command to install postgres DB:
```
./install_pgdb.sh
```
Command to create DB for AAS/SCS/SHVS:
```
./create_db.sh <DB Name> <DB Username> <DB Password>
```

Note that the db name, db username and db user password should match with the respective component environment files.

###  Database Server TLS Certificate

The database client for Intel® SecL services requires the database TLS certificate to authenticate communication with the database server.

If the database server for a service is located on the same server that the service will run on, only the path to this certificate is needed. If the provided Postgres scripts are used, the certificate will be in /usr/local/pgsql/data/server.crt.

If the database server will be run separately from the Intel® SecL service(s), the certificate will need to be copied from the database server to the service machine before installing the Intel® SecL services.

The database client for Intel® SecL services will validate that the Subject Alternative Names in the database server's TLS certificate contain the hostname(s)/IP address(es) that the clients will use to access the database server. If configuring a database without using the provided scripts, ensure that these attributes are present in the database TLS certificate.

## Installation of Containerized Services and Agent in K8s Cluster

The containerized deployment utilizes K8s orchestrator to deploy SGX components. The deployments are fairly automated once the pre-reqs are in place for K8s cluster deployments.

> **Note:** The K8s manifests are declarative in nature and the same can be modified as required for SGX services deployments for single node and multi node deployments. Modifications would require specific steps to ensure services and agents get updated as per the required configuration. More details for the same present in Setup Task Flows for K8s Deployments, Configuration Update Flows for K8s Deployments and [Intel Security Libraries Configuration Settings ](#intel-security-libraries-configuration-settings)

### Pre-requisites

* Ensure based on the deployment model , `microk8s` or `kubeadm` in installed. Supported versions in [Requirements for Containerized Deployment with K8s](#requirements-for-containerized-deployment-with-k8s)
* Docker runtime is configured for each of these deployments. Supported versions in [Requirements for Containerized Deployment with K8s](#requirements-for-containerized-deployment-with-k8s)
* The build would generate a script for platform dependencies under `<working directory>/k8s/platform dependencies`
* Follow the deployment pre-reqs as given in the [Quick Start guide](https://github.com/intel-secl/docs/blob/v3.6.1/develop/quick-start-guides/SGX%20Infrastructure%20-%20Containerization.md#deployment) based on the chosen deployment model

### Deploy Steps

* The deploy steps are detailed in the [Quick Start guide](https://github.com/intel-secl/docs/blob/v3.6.1/develop/quick-start-guides/SGX%20Infrastructure%20-%20Containerization.md#deploy-steps) based on the deployment model. Follow the instructions for the deployment using the scripts

## Installing the Certificate Management Service

### Required For

The CMS is REQUIRED for all use cases.

### Supported Operating System

The Intel® Security Libraries Certificate Management Service supports Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 and Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS(Bionic Beaver).

### Recommended Hardware

-   1 vCPUs

-   RAM: 2 GB

-   10 GB

-   One network interface with network access to all Intel® SecL-DC services

### Installation

To install the Intel® SecL-DC Certificate Management Service:

1.  Copy the Certificate Management Service installation binary to the /root/ directory.

2.  Create the `cms.env` installation answer file for an unattended installation:

AAS_TLS_SAN=\< Comma-Separated list of IPs and hostnames for the AAS\>

AAS_API_URL=https://\< Authentication and Authorization Service IP or Hostname\>:8444/aas/v1

SAN_LIST=< Comma-Separated list of IP addresses and hostnames for the CMS>

The SAN list will be used to authenticate the Certificate Signing Request from the AAS to the CMS. Only a CSR originating from a host matching the SAN list will be honored. Later, in the AAS authservice.env installation answer file, this same SAN list will be provided for the AAS installation. These lists must match and must be valid for IPs and/or hostnames used by the AAS system. The SAN list variables also accept the wildcards "?" (for single-character wildcards) and "\*" (for multiple-character wildcards) to allow address ranges or multiple FQDNs.

The AAS_API_URL represents the URL for the AAS that will exist after the AAS is installed.

For all configuration options and their descriptions, refer to the Intel® SecL Configuration section on the Certificate Management Service.

3.  Execute the installer binary.

./cms-v3.6.1.bin

When the installation completes, the Certificate Management Service is available. The services can be verified by running cms status from the command line.

\# cms status

After installation is complete, the CMS will output a bearer token to the console. This token will be used with the AAS during installation to authenticate certificate requests to the CMS. If this token expires or otherwise needs to be recreated, use the following command:

cms setup cms-auth-token \--force

In addition, the SHA384 digest of the CMS TLS certificate will be needed for installation of the remaining Intel® SecL services. The digest can be obtained using the following command:

cms tlscertsha384


## Installing the Authentication and Authorization Service

### Required For

The AAS is REQUIRED for all use cases.

### Prerequisites

The following must be completed before installing the Authentication and Authorization Service:

-   The Certificate Management Service must be installed and available

-   The Authentication and Authorization Service database must be available

### Package Dependencies

The Intel® SecL-DC Authentication and Authorization Service (AAS) requires a Postgresql 11 database. script (install_pgdb.sh) is provided with the AAS that will install Postgresql repositories.

### Supported Operating Systems

The Intel® Security Libraries Authentication and Authorization Service supports Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 and Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS(Bionic Beaver).

### Recommended Hardware

-   1 vCPUs

-   RAM: 2 GB

-   10 GB

-   One network interface with network access to all Intel® SecL-DC services

### Installation


Before AAS is installed, Database needs to be created. Use the following commands to install postgres and create AAS DB

copy install_pgdb.sh and create_db.sh to /root/ directory
```
./install_pgdb.sh

./create_db.sh <db name> <db_user> <db_password>
```

To install the AAS, a bearer token from the CMS is required. This bearer token is output at the end of the CMS installation. However, if a new token is needed, simply use the following command from the CMS command line:

cms setup cms-auth-token --force

Create the authservice.env installation answer file in /root/ directory as below:

      CMS_BASE_URL=https://< CMS IP or hostname>:8445/cms/v1/

      CMS_TLS_CERT_SHA384=<CMS TLS certificate sha384>

      AAS_DB_SSLMODE=verify-full

      AAS_DB_HOSTNAME=<IP or hostname of database server>

      AAS_DB_PORT=<database port number; default is 5432>

      AAS_DB_NAME=<database name>

      AAS_DB_USERNAME=<database username>

      AAS_DB_PASSWORD=<database password>

      AAS_DB_SSLCERTSRC=<path to database TLS certificate; the default location is typically /usr/local/pgsql/data/server.crt>

      AAS_ADMIN_USERNAME=<username for AAS administrative user>

      AAS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<password for AAS administrative user>

      AAS_JWT_TOKEN_DURATION_MINS=2880

      SAN_LIST=<comma-separated list of IPs and hostnames for the AAS; this should match the value for the AAS_TLS_SAN in the cms.env file from the CMS installation>

      BEARER_TOKEN=<bearer token from CMS installation>

Execute the AAS installer:

./authservice-v3.6.1.bin

Note: the AAS_ADMIN credentials specified in this answer file will have administrator rights for the AAS and can be used to create other users, create new roles, and assign roles to users.

### Creating Users

Before deployment is initiated, user account and roles must be generated for each component.  Most of these accounts will be service users, used by the various Intel® SecL SKC services to work together.

Creating these required users and roles is facilitated by the populate-user script.

### Creating Users and Roles

During installation of each services, number of user accounts and roles specific to services must be generated. Most of these accounts will be service users, which is used by the various services to function together. Another set of users will be used for installation permissions, and administrative user will be created to provide the initial authentication interface for the actual user based on the organizational requirements. Creating these required users and roles is facilitated by a script that will accept credentials and configuration settings from an answer file and automate the process.
Create the `populate-users.env` file using the following values:

```shell
# SKC Components include AAS,SCS,SHVS,SQVS,SIH and SKBS.
ISECL_INSTALL_COMPONENTS=AAS,SCS,SHVS,SQVS,SIH,SKBS

AAS_API_URL=https://<AAS IP address or hostname>:8444/aas/v1
AAS_ADMIN_USERNAME=<AAS username>
AAS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<AAS password>

IH_CERT_SAN_LIST=<comma-separated list of IPs and hostnames for the Integration Hub>
KBS_CERT_SAN_LIST=<comma-separated list of IPs and hostnames for the Key Broker Service>
SCS_CERT_SAN_LIST=<comma-separated list of IPs and hostnames for the SGX Caching Service>
SQVS_CERT_SAN_LIST=<comma-separated list of IPs and hostnames for the SGX Quote Verification Service>
SHVS_CERT_SAN_LIST=<comma-separated list of IPs and hostnames for the SGX Host Verification Service>

IHUB_SERVICE_USERNAME=<Username for the Hub service user>
IHUB_SERVICE_PASSWORD=<Password for the Hub service user>

SCS_SERVICE_USERNAME=<Username for the SCS service user>
SCS_SERVICE_PASSWORD=<Password for the SCS service user>

SHVS_SERVICE_USERNAME=<Username for the SHVS service user>
SHVS_SERVICE_PASSWORD=<Password for the SHVS service user>

KBS_SERVICE_USERNAME=<Username for the KBS service user>
KBS_SERVICE_PASSWORD=<Password for the KBS service user>

INSTALL_ADMIN_USERNAME=<Username for the Admin user>
INSTALL_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<Password for the Admin user>

CCC_ADMIN_USERNAME=<Username for the Custom Claims Creator Admin user>
CCC_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<Password for the Custom Claims Creator Admin user>

```
> **Note**: The `ISECL_INSTALL_COMPONENTS` variable is a comma-separated list of all the components that will be used in your environment. Not all services are required for every use case. Include only services which are required specific to the use case.

> **Note**: The SAN list variables each support wildcards( "*" and "?"). Using wildcards, domain names and entire IP ranges can be included in the SAN list, which will allow any host matching those ranges to install the relevant service. The SAN list specified here must exactly match the SAN list for the applicable service in that service’s env installation file.

Execute the populate-users script:
```shell
./populate-users
```

The script will automatically generate the following users:

-   Authentication and Authorization Service (AAS)
-   SGX Caching Service (SCS)
-   SGX Host Verificatin Service (SHVS)
-   Integration HUB (IHUB)
-   Key Broker Service (KBS) with backend key management
-   Installation Admin User
-   CCC Admin User

These user accounts will be used during installation of each components of SGX Attestation or SKC. In general, whenever credentials are required by an installation answer file, the variable name should match the name of the corresponding variable used in the `populate-users.env` file.

The populate-users script will also output an installation token. This token has all privileges needed for installation of the services, and uses the credentials provided with the `INSTALL_ADMIN_USERNAME` and `INSTALL_ADMIN_PASSWORD`. The remaining Intel ® SecL-DC services require this token (set as the `BEARER_TOKEN` variable in the installation env files) to grant the appropriate privileges for installation. By default this token will be valid for two hours; the populate-users script can be rerun with the same `populate-users.env` file to regenerate the token if more time is required, or the `INSTALL_ADMIN_USERNAME` and `INSTALL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` can be used to generate an authentication token.

* To setup k8 cluster on RHEL 8.2, follow https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-kubernetes-on-centos

* To setup k8 cluster on Ubuntu 18.04, follow the "Install, Enable and start the Docker daemon" section in Quick Start Guide - https://github.com/intel-secl/docs/blob/v3.6.1/develop/quick-start-guides/SGX%20Infrastructure.md
Once done, go to https://vitux.com/install-and-deploy-kubernetes-on-ubuntu/ and follow from step 3 onwards.

* Once the master/worker setup is done, follow below steps on Master Node:

### Untar packages and push OCI images to registry

* Copy tar output isecl-k8s-extensions-*.tar.gz from build system's binaries folder to /opt/ directory on the Master Node and extract the contents.

  ```shell
    cd /opt/
    tar -xvzf isecl-k8s-extensions-*.tar.gz
    cd isecl-k8s-extensions/
  ```

* Configure private registry

* Push images to private registry using skopeo command, (this can be done from build vm also)

  ```shell
     skopeo copy oci-archive:isecl-k8s-controller-v3.6.1-<commitid>.tar docker://<registryIP>:<registryPort>/isecl-k8s-controller:v3.6.1
     skopeo copy oci-archive:isecl-k8s-scheduler-v3.6.1-<commitid>.tar docker://<registryIP>:<registryPort>/isecl-k8s-scheduler:v3.6.1
  ```

* Add the image names in isecl-controller.yml and isecl-scheduler.yml in /opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/yamls with full image name including registry IP/hostname (e.g <registryIP>:<registryPort>/isecl-k8s-scheduler:v3.6.1). It will automatically pull the images from registry.


##### Deploy isecl-controller

* Create hostattributes.crd.isecl.intel.com crd

```
    kubectl apply -f yamls/crd-1.17.yaml
```

* Check whether the crd is created

```
	KUBERNETES_CRD=custom-isecl-sgx
```

##### Deploy isecl-scheduler

The isecl-scheduler default configuration is provided for common cluster support in /opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/yamls/isecl-scheduler.yaml.

Variables HVS_IHUB_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH and SGX_IHUB_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH are by default set to default paths.

Please use and set only required variables based on the use case.

For example, if only sgx based attestation is required then remove/comment HVS_IHUB_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH variables.

* Install cfssl and cfssljson on Kubernetes Control Plane
```
    #Download cfssl to /usr/local/bin/
    wget -O /usr/local/bin/cfssl http://pkg.cfssl.org/R1.2/cfssl_linux-amd64

-   Golang packages

If these are not already installed, the Integration Hub installer attempts to install these packages automatically using the package manager. Automatic installation requires access to package repositories (the RHEL/Ubuntu subscription repositories, the EPEL repository, or a suitable mirror), which may require an Internet connection. If the packages are to be installed from the package repository, be sure to update your repository package lists before installation.

### Supported Operating Systems

The Intel Security Libraries Integration Hub supports Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 and Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS(Bionic Beaver).

### Recommended Hardware

-   1 vCPUs

-   RAM: 2 GB

-   1 GB free space to install the Integration Hub (database and log space requirements are dependent on the number of managed servers).

-   One network interface with network access to the SGX Host Verification Service.

-   One network interface with network access to any integration endpoints (for example, OpenStack Nova).

#### Installing the Integration Hub

To install the SGX Integration Hub, follow these steps:

1. Copy the Integration Hub installation binary to the /root/ directory.

2. Create the ihub.env installation answer file in /root/ directory as below
```
    IHUB_SERVICE_USERNAME=< IHUB service user username >
    IHUB_SERVICE_PASSWORD=< IHUB service user password >
    SHVS_BASE_URL=< https://< SHVS IP or Hostname >:13000/sgx-hvs/v2
    CMS_TLS_CERT_SHA384=< CMS TLS digest >
    BEARER_TOKEN=<Installation token>

    AAS_API_URL=https://< AAS IP or Hostname >:8444/aas/v1
    CMS_BASE_URL=https://< CMS IP or Hostname >:8445/cms/v1
    POLL_INTERVAL_MINUTES=2
    TLS_SAN_LIST=< comma separated list of IPs and hostnames for the IHUB >
    TENANT=< tenant-type e.g. KUBERNETES or OPENSTACK >

    # Kubernetes Integration Credentials - required for Kubernetes integration only
    KUBERNETES_URL=< https://< Kubernetes IP >:6443/>
    KUBERNETES_CRD=custom-isecl-sgx
    KUBERNETES_TOKEN=< K8S token >
    KUBERNETES_CERT_FILE =< Path of Kubernetes master node certificate >

    # OpenStack Integration Credentials - required for OpenStack integration only
    OPENSTACK_AUTH_URL=<OpenStack Keystone URL; typically http://openstack-ip:5000/>
    OPENSTACK_PLACEMENT_URL=<OpenStack Nova Placement API URL; typically http://openstack-ip:8778/>
    OPENSTACK_USERNAME=< OpenStack username >
    OPENSTACK_PASSWORD=< OpenStack password >
```
3.  Create Integrated Hub Service user account and Roles. A sample script is provided in the appendix section for reference

Update the BEARER_TOKEN with the TOKEN obtained after running populate-users.sh script

4.  Execute the installer binary.

./ihub-v3.6.1.bin

In case installation fails, its recommended to run the following command to clear failed service instance

```
systemctl reset-failed
```

Copy IHUB public key to the master node and restart kubelet.

```
    scp -r /etc/ihub/ihub_public_key.pem <master-node IP>:/opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/
    systemctl restart kubelet
```

Run this command to validate if the data has been pushed to CRD:

```
    kubectl get -o json hostattributes.crd.isecl.intel.com
```

Run this command to validate that the labels have been populated:

```
    kubectl get nodes --show-labels.
```

Sample labels:

```
    EPC-Memory=2.0GB,FLC-Enabled=true,SGX-Enabled=true,SGX-Supported=true,SgxTrustExpiry=2020-11-09T08.07.43Z,TCBUpToDate=true
```

Create sample yml file for nginx workload and add SGX labels to it such as:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    name: nginx
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
     requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
       nodeSelectorTerms:
       - matchExpressions:
         - key: SGX-Enabled
           operator: In
           values:
           - "true"
         - key: EPC-Memory
           operator: In
           values:
           - "2.0GB"
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

Validate if pod can be launched on the node. Run following commands:

```
    kubectl apply -f pod.yml
    kubectl get pods
    kubectl describe pods nginx
```

Pod should be in running state and launched on the host as per values in pod.yml. Validate running below commands on sgx host:

```
	docker ps
```

## Integration with OpenStack (Supported only on RHEL 8.2, not supported on Ubuntu 18.04)

OpenStack can now use “Traits” to provide qualitative data about Nova Compute hosts to establish Trait requirements. The Integration Hub continually push SGX data to the OpenStack Traits resources. This means OpenStack scheduler natively supports workload scheduling incorporating SGX Host information, including SGX enabled/disabled, SGX supported/not supported, FLC enabled/not enabled, EPC memory size, TCB status upto date/not. The OpenStack Placement Service will automatically attempt to place images with Trait requirements on compute nodes that have those Traits.

NOTE: This control only applies to instances launched using the OpenStack scheduler, and the Traits functions will not affect manually-launched instances where a specific Compute Node is defined (since this does not use the scheduler at all). Intel SecL-DC uses existing OpenStack interfaces and does not modify OpenStack code.  The datacenter owner or OpenStack administrator is responsible for the security of the OpenStack workload scheduling process in general, and Intel recommends following published OpenStack security best practices.

Setting Image Traits
Image Traits define the policy for which Traits are required for that instance to be launched on a Nova Compute node.By setting these Traits to “required” the OpenStack scheduler will require the same Traits to be present on a Nova Compute node in order to launch instances. To set the Image Traits for Intel SecL-DC,a specific naming convention is used. This naming convention will match the Traits that the Integration Hub will automatically push to OpenStack. Two types of Traits are currently supported – one Trait is used to require that the Compute Node must be SGX supported and the other Trait is used to require specific SGXkey/value pairs.
Required Image trait for SGX Enabled Host:
```
CUSTOM_ISECL_SGX_ENABLED_TRUE=required
```
These Traits can be set using CLI commands for OpenStack Glance:
```
openstack image set --property trait:CUSTOM_ISECL_SGX_ENABLED_TRUE=required <image name>
```
To veiw the Traits that has been set:
```
openstack image show
```
List the set of resources mapped to the Openstack
```
openstack resource provider list
```
To view the traits enabled for the SGX Host:
```
openstack resource provider trait list <uuid of the host which the openstack resoruce provider lists>
```
Create the instances
```
openstack server create --flavor tiny --image <image name> --net vmnet <vm instance name>
```
Instances should be created and the status should be "Active". Instance should be launched successfully.
```
openstack server list
```
To remove a Trait that is not required for an Image:
```
openstack image unset --property trait:CUSTOM_ISECL_SGX_ENABLED_TRUE
openstack image unset --property trait:CUSTOM_ISECL_SGX_ENABLED_FALSE
```
Scheduling Instances
Once Trait requirements are set for Images and the Integration Hub is configured to push attributes to OpenStack, instances can be launched in OpenStack as normal. As long as the OpenStack Nova scheduler is used to schedule the workloads, only compliant Compute Nodes will be scheduled to run instances of controlled Images.

NOTE: This control only applies to instances launched using the OpenStack scheduler and the Traits functions will not affect manually-launched instances where a specific Compute Node is defined (since this does not use the scheduler at all). Intel SecL-DC uses existing OpenStack interfaces and does not modify OpenStack code. The datacenter owner or OpenStack administrator is responsible for the security of the
OpenStack workload scheduling process in general and Intel recommends following published OpenStack security best practices.


##  Installing the Key Broker Service

### Required for

The KBS is REQUIRED for

\- Storing Application Keys and Verifying the SGX Quote

### Prerequisites

The following must be completed before installing the Key Broker:

-   The Authentication and Authorization Service must be installed and available

-   The Certificate Management Service must be installed and available

If a 3rd-party Key Management server will be used following must be completed before installing the Key Broker:

-   A KMIP 3rd-party Key management Server must be available.

-   The Key Broker will require the KMIP server’s client certificate, client key and root ca certificate. This key and certificate will be available in KMIP server.

NOTE: The Key Broker has been validated using the pykmip 0.9.1 KMIP server as a 3rd-party Key Management Server. While any general KMIP 2.0-compliant Key Management Server should work, implementation differences among KMIP providers may prevent functionality with specific providers.

### Package Dependencies

N/A

### Supported Operating Systems

supports Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 and Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS(Bionic Beaver).

### Recommended Hardware

NA

### Installation

1. Copy the Key Broker installation binary to the /root/ directory.

2. Create the installation answer file kbs.env /root/ directory as below:

       KBS_SERVICE_USERNAME=< KBS service user username >

       KBS_SERVICE_PASSWORD=< KBS service user password >

       SERVER_PORT=9443

       AAS_API_URL=https://<AAS IP or hostname>:8444/aas/v1

       CMS_BASE_URL=https://<CMS IP or hostname>:8445/cms/v1/

       SQVS_URL=https://<SQVS IP or hostname>:12000/svs/v1

       ### KEY_MANAGER can be set to either Directory or KMIP

       KEY_MANAGER=

       ENDPOINT_URL=https://<KBS Hostname>:9443/v1

       TLS_COMMON_NAME="KBS TLS Certificate"

       SKC_CHALLENGE_TYPE="SGX,SW"

       CMS_TLS_CERT_SHA384=<SHA384 hash of CMS TLS certificate>

       TLS_SAN_LIST=<KBS Hostname/IP>

       BEARER_TOKEN=<Installation token from AAS>

       SESSION_EXPIRY_TIME=60

       ### OPTIONAL - If KEY_MANAGER set to KMIP then need to use following configuration.

       KMIP_SERVER_IP=<IP address of KMIP server>

       KMIP_SERVER_PORT=<Port number of KMIP server>

       KMIP_VERSION=<kmip version>

       ### Retrieve the following certificates and keys from the KMIP server

       KMIP_CLIENT_KEY_PATH=<path>/client_key.pem

       KMIP_ROOT_CERT_PATH=<path>/root_certificate.pem

       KMIP_CLIENT_CERT_PATH=<path>/client_certificate.pem

Update the BEARER_TOKEN with the TOKEN obtained after running populate-users.sh script

4.  Execute the KBS installer.

./kbs-3.6.1.bin

NOTE: When a 3rd-party Key Management Server is used, KBS supports only association of RSA key. User needs to create RSA key in backend kmip server and note the Private key Id. User also needs to create the tls certificate for the private key (it will be used during key transfer).
rsa-create.py available in kbs_scripts can be used to create the private key and generate the certificate by providing the kmip server ip and certificates path in the script.

##  Installing the SKC Library

### Required For

The SKC_Library enables secure transfer of application keys from KBS after performing SGX attestation. It stores the keys in the SGX enclave and performs crypto operations ensuring the keys are never exposed in use, at rest and in transit outside of enclave.

### Package Dependencies

The Intel® Security Libraries SKC Library requires the following packages and their dependencies

Openssl

Curl

### Supported Operation System

The Intel® Security Libraries SKC Library supports Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 and Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS(Bionic Beaver).

### Recommended Hardware

-   Icelake Server with SGX enabled in BIOS

-   RAM: 8 GB

-   100 GB

-   One network interface with network access to the Key Broker

### Installation
```
Copy skc_library.tar, skc_library.sha2 and skclib_untar.sh from binaries directoy to a directory in SGX compute node

./skclib_untar.sh

Update create_roles.conf with the following
  - IP address of AAS deployed on Enterprise system
  - Admin account credentials of AAS deployed on Enterprise system. These credentials should match with the AAS admin credentials provided in authservice.env on enterprise side.
  - Permission string to be embedded into skc_libraty client TLS Certificate
  - For Each SKC Library installation on a SGX compute node, please change SKC_USER and SKC_USER_PASSWORD

Save and Close

./skc_library_create_roles.sh
Copy the token printed on console.

Update skc_library.conf with the following
  - IP address for CMS and KBS services deployed on Enterprise system
  - CSP_CMS_IP should point to the IP of CMS service deployed on CSP system
  - CSP_SCS_IP should point to the IP of SCS service deployed on CSP system
  - Hostname of the Enterprise system where KBS is deployed
  - Network Port numbers for CMS and SCS services deployed on CSP system
  - Network Port numbers for CMS and KBS services deployed on Enterprise system
  - For Each SKC Library installation on a SGX compute node, please change SKC_USER (should be same as SKC_USER provided in create_roles.conf)
  - SKC_TOKEN with the token copied from previous step

Save and Close

./deploy_skc_library.sh
```
#### Deploying SKC Library as a Container (Supported only on RHEL 8.2, not supported on Ubuntu 18.04)
```
Use the following steps to configure SKC library running in a container and to validate key transfer in container on bare metal and inside a VM on SGX enabled hosts.

Note: All the configuration files required for SKC Library container are modified in the resources directory only

1. Docker should be installed, enabled and services should be active

2. In the build System, SKC Library tar file "<skc-lib*>.tar" required to load is located in the "/root/workspace/skc_library" directory.  

3. Copy "resources" folder from "workspace/skc_library/container/resources" to the "/root/" directory of SGX host. Inside the resources folder all the key transfer flow related files will be available.

4. Update sgx_default_qcnl.conf file inside resources folder with SCS IP and SCS port and update hosts file present in same folder with KBS IP and hostname.

5. Generate the RSA key in the kbs host and copy it to SGX host.

6. Refer to openssl and nginx sub sections of QSG in the "Configuration for NGINX testing" to configure nginx.conf and openssl.conf present resource in the directory.

7. Update keyID in the keys.txt and nginx.conf.

8. Under [core] section of pkcs11-apimodule.ini in the "/root/resources/" directory add preload_keys=/root/keys.txt.

9. Update skc_library.conf with IP addresses where SKC services are deployed.

10. On the SGX Compute node, load the skc library docker image provided in the tar file.
   docker load < <SKC_Library>.tar

11. Provide valid paramenets in the docker run command and execute the docker run command. Update the genertaed RSA Key ID and <keys>.crt in the resources directory.
    docker run -p 8080:2443 -p 80:8080 --mount type=bind,source=/root/<KBS_cert>.crt,target=/root/<KBS_cert>.crt --mount type=bind,source=/root/resources/sgx_default_qcnl.conf,target=/etc/sgx_default_qcnl.conf --mount type=bind,source=/root/resources/nginx.conf,target=/etc/nginx/nginx.conf --mount type=bind,source=/root/resources/keys.txt,target=/root/keys.txt,readonly --mount type=bind,source=/root/resources/pkcs11-apimodule.ini,target=/opt/skc/etc/pkcs11-apimodule.ini,readonly --mount type=bind,source=/root/resources/openssl.cnf,target=/etc/pki/tls/openssl.cnf --mount type=bind,source=/root/resources/skc_library.conf,target=/skc_library.conf --add-host=<SHC_HOSTNAME>:<SGX_HOST_IP> --add-host=<KBS_Hostname>:<KBS host IP> --mount type=bind,source=/dev/sgx,target=/dev/sgx --cap-add=SYS_MODULE --privileged=true <SKC_LIBRARY_IMAGE_NAME>

    Note: In the above docker run command, source refers to the actual path of the files located on the host and the target always refers to the files which would be mounted inside the container

12. Restore index.html for the transferred key inside the container
    Get the container id using "docker ps" command
    docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/sh

    Download index.html
    wget https://localhost:2443 --no-check-certificate
```

# Authentication

Authentication is centrally managed by the Authentication and Authorization Service (AAS). This service uses a Bearer Token authentication method. This service also centralizes the creation of roles and users, allowing much easier management of users, passwords, and permissions across all Intel® SecL-DC services.

To make an API request to an Intel® SecL-DC service, an authentication token is required. API requests must now include an Authorization header with a valid token

The token is issued by AAS and expires after a set amount of time. This token may be used with any Intel® SecL-DC service and will carry the appropriate permissions for the role(s) assigned to the account the token was generated for.

The SKC solution involves AAS deployments for 2 different domains: the CSP domain and the tenant domain. There is no trust relationship between the 2 deployments.

In SKC, the accounts of the SGX Services are created at install time. However, CSP admin users must obtain AAS tokens to invoke admin APIs in the SGX Host Verification Service (SHVS), the SGX Hub, the SGX Caching Service (SCS) and AAS.

Similarly, the tenant admin needs AAS tokens to invoke Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) APIs in KBS and admin APIs in AAS.

The following sections present how to use AAS APIs to create tokens and manage users.

## Create Token

To request a new token from the AAS:

POST https://\<AAS IP or hostname\>:8444/aas/v1/token

{

\"username\" : \"\<username\>\",

\"password\" : \"\<password\>\"

}

The response will be a token that can be used in the Authorization header for other requests. The length of time for which the token will be valid is configured on the AAS using the key ~AAS_JWT_TOKEN_DURATION_MINS~ (in the installation answer file during installation) or aas.jwt.token.duration.mins (configured on the AAS after installation). In both cases the value is the length of time in minutes that issued tokens will remain valid before expiring.

## User Management

Users in Intel® SecL-DC are centrally managed by the Authentication and Authorization Service (AAS). Any user may be assigned roles for any service, allowing user accounts to be fully defined by the tasks needed

### Username and Password Requirement

Passwords have the following constraints:

-   cannot be empty - ie must at least have one character

-   maximum length of 255 characters

Usernames have the following requirements:

-   Format: username\[\@host_name\[domain\]\]

-   \[\@host_name\[domain\]\] is optional

-   username shall be minimum of 2 and maximum of 255 characters

-   username allowed characters are alphanumeric, ., -, \_ - but cannot start with -.

-   Domain name must meet requirements of a host name or fully qualified internet host name

-   (Update it relevant to SKC)

### Create User

POST https://\<IP or hostname of AAS\>:8444/aas/v1/users

Authorization: Bearer \<token\>

{

\"username\" : \"\<username\>\",

\"password\" : \"\<password\>\"

}

### Search Users by Username

GET https://\<IP or hostname of AAS\>:8444/aas/v1/users?name=\<value\>

Authorization: Bearer \<token\>

### Change User Password

PATCH https://\<IP or hostname of AAS\>:8444/aas/v1/users/changepassword

{

\"username\": \"\<username\>\",

\"old_password\": \"\<old_password\>\",

\"new_password\": \"\<new_password\>\",

\"password_confirm\": \"\<new_password\>\" }

### Delete User

DELETE https://\<IP or hostname of AAS\>:8444/aas/v1/users/\<User ID\>

Authorization: Bearer \<token\>

## Roles and Permission

Permissions in Intel® SecL-DC are managed by Roles. Roles are a set of predefined permissions applicable to a specific service. Any number of Roles may be applied to a User. While new Roles can be created, each Intel® SecL service defines permissions that are applicable to specific predetermined Roles. This means that only pre-defined Roles will actually have any permissions. Role creation is intended to allow Intel® SecL-DC services to define their permissions while allowing role and user management to be centrally managed on the AAS. When a new service is installed, it will use the Role creation functions to define roles applicable for that service in the AAS.

### Create Roles

POST https://\<AAS IP or Hostname\>:8444/aas/v1/roles

Authorization: Bearer \<token\>

{

\"service\": \"\<Service name\>\",

\"name\": \"\<Role Name\>\".

"permissions": \[\<array of permissions\>\]

}

-   Service field contains a minimum of 1 and maximum of 20 characters. Allowed characters are alphanumeric plus the special charecters -, \_, @, ., ,

-   Name field contains a minimum of 1 and maximum of 40 characters. Allowed characters are alphanumeric plus the special characters -, \_, @, ., ,

-   Service and Name fields are mandatory

-   Context field is optional and can contain up to 512 characters. Allowed characters are alphanumeric plus -, \_, @, ., ,,=,;,:,\*

-   Permissions field is optional and allow up to a maximum of 512 characters.

The Permissions array must a comma-separated list of permissions formatted as resource:action:

Permissions required to execute specific API requests are listed with the API resource and method definitions in the API documentation.

### Search Roles

GET https://\<AAS IP or Hostname\>:8444/aas/v1/roles?\<parameter\>=\<value\>

Authorization: Bearer \<token\>

Search parameters supported:

Service=\<name of service\>

Name=\<role name\>

Context=\<context\>

contextContains=\<partial "context" string\>

allContexts=\<true or false\> filter=false

### Delete Role

DELETE https://\<AAS IP or Hostname\>:8444/aas/v1/roles/\<role ID\> Authorization:

Bearer \<token\>

### Assign Role to User

POST https://\<AAS IP or Hostname\>:8444/aas/v1/users/\<user ID\>/roles

Authorization: Bearer \<token\>

{

\"role_ids\": \[\"\<comma-separated list of role IDs\>\"\]

}

### List Roles Assigned to User

GET https://\<AAS IP or Hostname\>:8444/aas/v1/users/\<user ID\>/roles

Authorization: Bearer \<token\>

### Remove Role from User

## SGX Agent

The SGX Agent communicates with SGX Caching Service (SCS) and SGX Host Verification Service (SHVS) directly. Authentication has been centralized with the new Authentication and Authorization Service.

# SGX Features Provisioning

## Host Registration

Host Registration creates a host record with host information in the SGX Host Verification Service database when SGX Agent update SGX enablement information for the first time.

# Setup Task Flows for K8s Deployments

Setup tasks flows have been updated to have K8s native flow to be more agnostic to K8s workflows. Following would be the flow for setup task. The setup task options are detailed under [Intel Security Libraries Configuration Settings](#intel-security-libraries-configuration-settings) for each service and agent

- User would create a new `configMap`  object with the environment variables specific to the setup task. The Setup task variables would be documented in the Product Guide
- Users can provide variables for more than one setup task
- Users need to add `SETUP_TASK: "<setup task name>/<comma separated setup task name>"` in the same `configMap`
- Provide a unique name to the new `configMap`
- Provide the same name in the `deployment.yaml` under `configMapRef` section
- Deploy the specific service again with  ` kubectl kustomize . | kubectl  apply -f -`

# Configuration Update Flows for K8s Deployments

Configuration Update flows have been updated to have K8s native flow to be more agnostic to K8s workflows using `configMap` only. Following would be the flow for configuration update. The config task options are are detailed under [Intel Security Libraries Configuration Settings](#intel-security-libraries-configuration-settings) for each service and agent

- User would create a new `configMap`  object using existing one and update the new values. The list of config variables would be documented in the Product Guide
- Users can update variables for more than one
- Users need to add `SETUP_TASK: "update-service-config"` in the same `configMap`
- Provide a unique name to the new `configMap`
- Provide the same name in the `deployment.yaml` under `configMapRef` section
- Deploy the specific service again with  ` kubectl  kustomize . | kubectl  apply -f -`

> **Note:** Incase of agents, setup tasks or configuration updates done through above flows will be applied for all the agents running on different BMs. In order to run setup task or update configuration for individual agents, then user need to perform `kubectl exec -it <pod_name> /bin/bash` into a particular agent pod and run the specific setup task.

# Intel Security Libraries Configuration Settings

> **Note:** All the answer file options would remain common for containerized K8s deployments with the except of URLS where Kubernetes DNS would be used. The respective `configMap.yml` for each service and agent would carry the defaults for the same when built under `<working directory>/k8s/manifests/<service/agent/db names>`

    rm -rf /opt/isecl-k8s-extensions
    rm -rf /var/log/isecl-k8s-extensions
```

# Binary Upgrades

***NOTE:***  Before performing any upgrade, Intel strongly recommends backing up the database for the SHVS, SCS, and AAS.  See Postgres documentation for detailed options for backing up databases.  Below is a sample method for backing up an entire database server:

```
Backup to tar file:
pg_dump --dbname <database_name> --username=<database username> -F t > <database_backup_file>.tar
Restore from tar file:
pg_restore --dbname=<database_name> --username=<database username><database_backup_file>.tar
```

Some upgrades may involve changes to database content, and a backup will ensure that data is not lost in the case of an error during the upgrade process.

## Backward Compatibility

In general Intel SecL services are made to be backward-compatible within a given major release (for example, the 3.6.1 SHVS should be compatible with the 3.5 SGX Agent) in an upgrade priority order (see below).  Major version upgrades may require coordinated upgrades across all services.

## Upgrade Order

Upgrades should be performed in the following order to prevent misconfiguration or any service unavailability:

1) CMS, AAS

2) SCS, SHVS

3) SQVS, KBS, SGX Agent

Upgrading in this order will make each service unavailable only for the duration of the upgrade for that service.  

## Upgrade Process

### Binary Installations

For services installed directly (not deployed as containers), the upgrade process simply requires executing the new-version installer on the same machine where the old-version is running.  The installer will re-use the same configuration elements detected in the existing version's config file.  No additional answer file is required.

# Container Upgrades

Container upgrades will be supported only on multi node deployments and will be based on recreate strategy from v3.6 to v4.0. All services except KBS can be upgraded just by updating the image name and tag to newer version in respective deployment.yml files.

## Backup and roll back applicable to all services

1.	Take back up of data in NFS mount for all services from NFS server system <NFS-Mount-Path>/isecl
2.	If upgrade is not successful, then update deployment.yml files with older images(v3.6) for 4.0 upgrade path and restore the backed up NFS data at same mount path.
3.	Bring up individual components with ./isecl-bootstrap.sh up <service>.

**Note:** If in case service fails to start or gets crashed, then copy all the backed up data as per folder structure like how was it earlier. Bring up DB instance pointing to backed up data and bring up component deployment by pointing to older version of container image.

## Backward Compatibility

In general Intel SecL services are made to be backward-compatible within a given major release (for example, the  SHVS should be compatible with the 3.5 SGX Agent) in an upgrade priority order (see below). Major version upgrades may require coordinated upgrades across all services.

## Upgrade Order

Upgrades should be performed in the following order to prevent misconfiguration or any service unavailability:

1.	CMS, AAS
2.	SCS, SHVS
3.	SQVS, KBS, SGX Agent
4.	ISECL-CONTROLLER, IHUB, ISECL-SCHEDULER

Upgrading in this order will make each service unavailable only for the duration of the upgrade for that service.

## Upgrade Process

### Container Installations

Assuming all services for any use-case are up and running.

Push all the newer version of container images to registry. All oci images will be in k8s/container-images.

e.g
```
skopeo copy oci-archive:<oci-image-tar-name> docker://<registry-ip/hostname>:<registry-port>/<image-name>:<image-tag> --dest-tls-verify=false
```

#### Individual services upgrade except KBS

1.	Update the image name in existing deployment.yml of respective service.
2.	Redeploy by running the below command, By doing "kubectl apply -f" on deployment.yml with change in image name will terminate service with older image version and bring up service with new image version.

```
cd /k8s/manifests/<service-manifests-folder> &&  kubectl kustomize . | kubectl apply -f -
e.g cd /k8s/manifests/cms && kubectl kustomize . | kubectl apply -f -
```

#### KBS Upgrade

1.	Update the image name with new image name/image tag in existing deployment.yml.
2.	Copy upgrade-job.yml from builds k8s/manifests/kbs/upgrade-job.yml into control plane node k8s/manifests/kbs/
```
scp <build-vm>:<build-dir>/k8s/manifests/kbs/upgrade-job.yml <control-plane-vm>:<existing dir>/k8s/manifests/kbs/upgrade-job.yml
```
3.	Add the following variables in kbs/configMap.yml
```
KMIP_HOSTNAME: <kmip fqdn or ip>
```
Run the command
```
kubectl apply -f kbs/configMap.yml --namespace=isecl
```
4.	(Optional) Add the following variables in kbs/secrets.yml if required KMIP_USERNAME and KMIP_PASSWORD Run the following commands
```
kubectl delete secret -n isecl kbs-secret
kubectl create secret generic kbs-secret --from-file=kbs/secrets.txt --namespace=isecl
```
5.	Update "image-name" and "image-tag" and existing version of deployed kbs in "current deployed version" in k8s/manifests/kbs/upgrade-job.yml
```
      containers:
        - name: kbs
          image: <image-name>:<image-tag>
          imagePullPolicy: Always
          securityContext:
            runAsUser: 1001
            runAsGroup: 1001
          env:
            - name: CONFIG_DIR
              value: "/etc/kbs"
            - name: COMPONENT_VERSION
              value: <current deployed version>
```
6.	Run the upgrade job,
```
cd k8s/manifests
kubectl delete deployment -n isecl kbs-deployment
kubectl apply -f kbs/upgrade-job.yml
```
7.	Check the status of kbs-upgrade job for completion.
```
kubectl get jobs -n isecl
kubectl logs -n isecl kbs-upgrade-<pod id>
```
8.	Update the image name in kbs/deployment.yml to newer version and deploy the latest kbs
```
kubectl apply -f kbs/deployment.yml or cd kbs && kubectl kustomize . | kubectl apply -f -
```

# Appendix

**Important Note:** SGX Attestation fails when SGX is enabled on a host booted using tboot

**Root Cause:** tboot requires the "noefi" kernel parameter to be passed during boot, in order to not use an unmeasured EFI runtime services. As a result, the kernel does not expose EFI variables to user-space. SGX Attestation requires these EFI variables to fetch Platform Manifest data.

**Workaround:**

The EFI variables required by SGX are only needed during the SGX provisioning/registration phase. Once this step is completed successfully, access to the EFI variables is no longer required. This means this issue can be worked around by installing the SGX agent without booting to tboot, then rebooting the system to tboot. SGX attestation will then work as expected while booted to tboot.

1. Enable SGX and TXT in the platform BIOS

2. Perform SGX Factory Reset and boot into the “plain” distribution kernel (without tboot or TCB)

3. Install tboot and ISecL components (SGX Agent, Trust Agent and Workload Agent)

4. The SGX Agent installation fetches the SGX Platform Manifest data and caches it

5. Reboot the system into the tboot kernel mode.

6. Verify that TXT measured launch was successful:

   `txt-stat |grep "TXT measured launch"`

7. The SGX and Platform Integrity Attestation use cases should now work as normal.


### SGX Attestation flow
```
To Deploy SampleApp:
  Copy sample_apps.tar, sample_apps.sha2 and sampleapps_untar.sh from binaries directory to a directory in SGX compute node and untar it using './sample_apps_untar.sh'
  Install Intel® SGX SDK for Linux*OS into /opt/intel/sgxsdk using './install_sgxsdk.sh'
  Install SGX dependencies using './deploy_sgx_dependencies.sh'
Note: Make sure to deploy SQVS with includetoken configuration as false.

To Verify the SampleApp flow:
  Update sample_apps.conf with the following
   - IP address for SQVS services deployed on Enterprise system
   - IP address for SCS services deployed on CSP system
   - ENTERPRISE_CMS_IP should point to the IP of CMS service deployed on Enterprise system
   - Network Port numbers for SCS services deployed on CSP system
   - Network Port numbers for SQVS and CMS services deployed on Enterprise system
   - Set RUN_ATTESTING_APP to yes if user wants to run both apps in same machine
  Run SampleApp using './run_sample_apps.sh'
  Check the output of attestedApp and attestingApp under out/attested_app_console_out.log and out/attesting_app_console_out.log files

```

### Creating RSA Keys in Key Broker Service

**Steps to run KMIP Server**

Note: Below mentioned steps are provided as script (install_pykmip.sh and pykmip.service) as part of kbs_script folder which will install KMIP Server as daemon. Refer to ‘Install KMIP Server as daemon’ section.

```
1. Install python3 and vim-common
   For RHEL 8.2
   # dnf -y install python3-pip vim-common  
   For Ubuntu 18.04     
   # apt -y install python3-pip vim-common    
   ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python  > /dev/null 2>&1
   ln -s /usr/bin/pip3 /usr/bin/pip  > /dev/null 2>&1

2. Install pykmip
   # pip3 install pykmip==0.9.1

3. In the /etc/ directory create pykmip and policies folders
   mkdir -p /etc/pykmip/policies

4. Configure pykmip server using server.conf
   Update hostname in the server.conf

5. Copy the following to /etc/pykmip/ from kbs_script folder available under binaries directory
   create_certificates.py, run_server.py, server.conf

6. Create certificates
   > cd /etc/pykmip
   > python3 create_certificates.py

7. Kill running KMIP Server processes and wait for 10 seconds until all the KMIP Server processes are killed.
   > ps -ef | grep run_server.py | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill

8. Run pykmip server using run_server.py script
   > python3 run_server.py &

```

**Install KMIP Server as daemon**

```
1. cd into /root/binaries/kbs_script folder

2. Configure pykmip server using server.conf
   Update hostname in the server.conf

3. Run the install_pykmip.sh script and KMIP server will be installed as daemon process
   ./install_pykmip.sh

```

**Create RSA key in PyKMIP and generate certificate**

NOTE: This step is required only when PyKMIP script is used as a backend KMIP server.

```
1. Update Host IP in /root/binaries/kbs_script rsa_create.py script
2. In the kbs_script folder, Run rsa_create.py script
    > cd /root/binaries/kbs_script
    > python3 rsa_create.py

This script will generate “Private Key ID” and “Server certificate”, which should be provided in the kbs.conf file for “KMIP_KEY_ID” and “SERVER_CERT”.

```
**Configuration Update to create Keys in KBS**

	cd into /root/binaries/kbs_script folder

	**To register keys with KBS KMIP**

	Update the following variables in kbs.conf:

	    KMIP_KEY_ID (Private key ID registered in KMIP server)

# KBS key-transfer flow validation

On SGX compute node, Execute below commands for KBS key-transfer:


Note: Before initiating key transfer make sure, PYKMIP server is running.

```
    pkill nginx
```

Remove any existing pkcs11 token

```
    rm -rf /opt/intel/cryptoapitoolkit/tokens/*
```

Initiate Key tranfer from KBS

```
    systemctl restart nginx
```

Changing group ownership and permissions of pkcs11 token
```
    chown -R root:intel /opt/intel/cryptoapitoolkit/tokens/
    chmod -R 770 /opt/intel/cryptoapitoolkit/tokens/
```

Establish tls session with the nginx using the key transferred inside the enclave

```
    wget https://localhost:2443 --no-check-certificate
```

# Note on Key Transfer Policy

Key transfer policy is used to enforce a set of policies which need to be compiled with before the secret can be securely provisioned onto a sgx enclave

A typical Key Transfer Policy would look as below
```
        "sgx_enclave_issuer_anyof":["83d719e77deaca1470f6baf62a4d774303c899db69020f9c70ee1dfc08c7ce9e"],
        "sgx_enclave_issuer_product_id_anyof":0,
        "sgx_enclave_measurement_anyof":["ad46749ed41ebaa2327252041ee746d3791a9f2431830fee0883f7993caf316a"],
        "tls_client_certificate_issuer_cn_anyof":["CMSCA", "CMS TLS Client CA"],
        "client_permissions_allof":["nginx","USA"],
        "sgx_enforce_tcb_up_to_date":false
```

**sgx_enclave_issuer_anyof** establishes the signing identity provided by an authority who has signed the sgx enclave. in other words the owner of the enclave

**sgx_enclave_measurement_anyof** represents the cryptographic hash of the enclave log (enclave code, data)

**sgx_enforce_tcb_up_to_date** - If set to true, Key Broker service will provision the key only of the platform generating the quote conforms to the latest Trusted Computing Base

**client_permissions_allof** - Special permission embedded into the skc_library client TLS certificate which can enforce additional restrictons on who can get access to the key,
    In above example: the key is provisioned only to the nginx workload and platform which is tagged with value for ex: USA

## Extracting SGX Enclave values for Key Transfer Policy

Values that are specific to the enclave such as sgx_enclave_issuer_anyof, sgx_enclave_measurement_anyof and sgx_enclave_issuer_product_id_anyof can be retrived using `sgx_sign` utility that is available as part of Intel SGX SDK.

Run `sgx_sign` utility on the signed enclave (This command should be run on the build system).
```
    /opt/intel/sgxsdk/bin/x64/sgx_sign dump -enclave <path to the signed enclave> -dumpfile info.txt
```

- For `sgx_enclave_issuer_anyof`, in info.txt, search for "mrsigner->value" . E.g mrsigner->value :
  ```
  mrsigner->value: "0x83 0xd7 0x19 0xe7 0x7d 0xea 0xca 0x14 0x70 0xf6 0xba 0xf6 0x2a 0x4d 0x77 0x43 0x03 0xc8 0x99 0xdb 0x69 0x02 0x0f 0x9c 0x70 0xee 0x1d 0xfc 0x08 0xc7 0xce 0x9e"
  ```
  Remove the whitespace and 0x characters from the above string and add it to the policy file. E.g :
  ```
  "sgx_enclave_issuer_anyof":["83d719e77deaca1470f6baf62a4d774303c899db69020f9c70ee1dfc08c7ce9e"]
  ```
- For `sgx_enclave_measurement_anyof`, in info.txt, search for metadata->enclave_css.body.enclave_hash.m . E.g metadata->enclave_css.body.enclave_hash.m :
  ```
  metadata->enclave_css.body.enclave_hash.m:
  0xad 0x46 0x74 0x9e 0xd4 0x1e 0xba 0xa2 0x32 0x72 0x52 0x04 0x1e 0xe7 0x46 0xd3
  0x79 0x1a 0x9f 0x24 0x31 0x83 0x0f 0xee 0x08 0x83 0xf7 0x99 0x3c 0xaf 0x31 0x6a
  ```
  Remove the whitespace and 0x characters from the above string and add it to the policy file. E.g :
  ```
  "sgx_enclave_measurement_anyof":["ad46749ed41ebaa2327252041ee746d3791a9f2431830fee0883f7993caf316a"]
  ```
Please note that the SGX Enclave measurement value will depend on the toolchain used to build and link the SGX enclave. Hence the SGX Enclave measurement value would differ across OS flavours.
