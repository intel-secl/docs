# **SGX Attestation Infrastructure and Secure Key Caching (SKC) Quick Start Guide**

[[_TOC_]]

## **1. Hardware & OS Requirements**

1. **Four Hosts or VMs**

   a.    Build System

   b.    CSP managed Services 

   c.    Enterprise Managed Services

   d.    K8S Master Node Setup

2. **SGX Enabled Host**

3. **OS Requirements**

   UBUNTU 18.04. SKC Solution is built, installed and tested with root privileges. Please ensure that all the following instructions are executed with root privileges

   **Assumption:**

   CSP and Enterprise side deployment will be done through Ansible-Galaxy role;

## **2. Network Requirements**

1. **Build System**

   Internet access required

2. **CSP Managed Services** 

   Internet access required for SGX Caching Service deployed on CSP system/SGX Compute Node;

3. **Enterprise Managed Services**

   Internet access required for SGX Caching Service deployed on Enterprise system;

4. **SGX Enabled Host**

   Internet access required to access KBS running on Enterprise environment

**Setting Proxy and No Proxy**

```
export http_proxy=http://<proxy-url>:<proxy-port>
export https_proxy=http://<proxy-url>:<proxy-port>
export no_proxy=0.0.0.0,127.0.0.1,localhost,<CSP IP>,<Enterprise IP>, <SGX Compute Node IP>, <KBS system Hostname>
```

**Firewall Settings**

Ensure that all the SKC service ports are accessible with firewall

## **3. Ubuntu Package Requirements**

Access required for the postgresql repo in all systems, through below steps:

**Create the file repository configuration**
```
sh -c 'echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list'
```

## **4. Deployment Model**

![deploy_model](./images/isecl_deploy_model.PNG)

* Build + Deployment Machine

* CSP - ISecL Services Machine

* CSP - Physical Server as per supported configurations

* Enterprise - ISecL Services Machine


## **5. Ubuntu System Tools and Utilities**

**Ubuntu System Tools and utils**

```
apt-get install -y git gcc zip wget make python3 python3-yaml python3-pip tar lsof jq nginx curl libssl-dev
ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python
ln -s /usr/bin/pip3 /usr/bin/pip
apt-get update
apt-get install makeself

Install latest libkmip for KBS
git clone https://github.com/openkmip/libkmip.git
cd libkmip
make install

```

***Repo Tool***

```
tmpdir=$(mktemp -d)
git clone https://gerrit.googlesource.com/git-repo $tmpdir
install -m 755 $tmpdir/repo /usr/local/bin
rm -rf $tmpdir
```

***Golang Installation***

```
wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.14.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzf go1.14.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo mv go /usr/local
export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
export PATH=$GOROOT/bin:$PATH
rm -rf go1.14.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```


## **6. Build Services, Libraries and Install packages**

Note: currently, the repos contain the source code of both the SGX Attestation Infrastructure and SKC. Make will build and package all the binaries and installation scripts  but the SGX Attestation Infrastructure can be installed and deployed separately. SKC cannot be installed without the SGX Attestation Infrastructure. 

The rest of this document will indicate steps that are only needed for SKC. 

**Pulling Source Code**

```
mkdir -p /root/workspace && cd /root/workspace
repo init -u https://github.com/intel-secl/build-manifest.git -b refs/tags/v3.4.0 -m manifest/skc.xml
repo sync
```

**Install, Enable and start the Docker daemon**

  ```shell
  wget https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/dists/bionic/pool/stable/amd64/containerd.io_1.2.10-3_amd64.deb 
  dpkg -i containerd.io_1.2.10-3_amd64.deb
  wget "https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/dists/bionic/pool/stable/amd64/docker-ce-cli_19.03.5~3-0~ubuntu-bionic_amd64.deb"
  dpkg -i docker-ce-cli_19.03.5~3-0~ubuntu-bionic_amd64.deb
  wget "https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/dists/bionic/pool/stable/amd64/docker-ce_19.03.5~3-0~ubuntu-bionic_amd64.deb"
  dpkg -i docker-ce_19.03.5~3-0~ubuntu-bionic_amd64.deb

  systemctl enable docker
  systemctl start docker

  ```

**Ignore the below steps if not running behind a proxy**

  ```shell
  mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d
  touch /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/proxy.conf
  
  #Add the below lines in proxy.conf and set proxy server details if proxy is used
  [Service]
  Environment="HTTP_PROXY=<http_proxy>"
  Environment="HTTPS_PROXY=<https_proxy>"
  Environment="NO_PROXY=<no_proxy>"
  ```

  ```shell
  #Reload docker
  systemctl daemon-reload
  systemctl restart docker
  ```
**Building All SKC Components**

```
make

```

**Copy Binaries to a clean folder**

```
For CSP/Enterprise Deployment Model, copy the generated binaries directory to the /root directory on the CSP/Enterprise system
For Single system model, copy the generated binaries directory to the /root directory on the deployment system
```

## **7. Deployment & Usecase Workflow Tools Installation**

The below installation is required on the Build & Deployment system only and the Platform(Windows,Linux or MacOS) for Usecase Workflow Tool Installation

**Deployment Tools Installation**

* Install Ansible on Build Machine

  ```shell
  pip3 install ansible==2.9.10
  ```

* Install `sshpass` for ansible to connect to remote hosts using SSH

  ```shell
  apt-get install sshpass
  ```

* Create directory for ansible default configuration and hosts file

  ```shell
  mkdir -p /etc/ansible/
  touch /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
  ```

* Copy the `ansible.cfg` contents from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/v2.9.10/examples/ansible.cfg and paste it under `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`


### Usecases Workflow Tools Installation

* Postman client should be [downloaded](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) on supported platforms or on the web to get started with the usecase collections.

  > **Note:** The Postman API Network will always have the latest released version of the API Collections. For all releases, refer the github repository for [API Collections](https://github.com/intel-secl/utils/tree/v3.4/develop/tools/api-collections)


## **8. Deployment**

The below details would enable the deployment through Ansible Role for Intel® SecL-DC Secure Key Caching Usecase. However the services can still be installed manually using the Product Guide. More details on Ansible Role for Intel® SecL-DC in [Ansible-Role](https://github.com/intel-secl/utils/tree/v3.4/develop/tools/ansible-role) repository.

### Download the Ansible Role 

The role can be cloned locally from git and the contents can be copied to the roles folder used by your ansible server 

```shell
#Create directory for using ansible deployment
mkdir -p /root/intel-secl/deploy/

#Clone the repository
cd /root/intel-secl/deploy/ && git clone https://github.com/intel-secl/utils.git

#Checkout to specific release version
cd utils/
git checkout <release-version of choice>
cd tools/ansible-role

#Update ansible.cfg roles_path to point to path(/root/intel-secl/deploy/utils/tools/)
```

### Update Ansible Inventory

The following inventory can be used and created under `/etc/ansible/hosts`.

```
[CSP]
<machine1_ip/hostname>

[Enterprise]
<machine2_ip/hostname>

[Node]
<machine3_ip/hostname>

[CSP:vars]
isecl_role=csp
ansible_user=<ubuntu_user>
ansible_sudo_pass=<password>
ansible_password=<password>

[Enterprise:vars]
isecl_role=enterprise
ansible_user=<ubuntu_user>
ansible_sudo_pass=<password>
ansible_password=<password>

[Node:vars]
isecl_role=node
ansible_user=<ubuntu_user>
ansible_sudo_pass=<password>
ansible_password=<password>
```

> **Note:** Ansible requires `ssh` and `root` user access to remote machines. The following command can be used to ensure ansible can connect to remote machines with host key check `
  ```shell
  ssh-keyscan -H <ip_address> >> /root/.ssh/known_hosts
  ```

### Create and Run Playbook

The following are playbook and CLI example for deploying Intel® SecL-DC binaries based on the supported deployment models and usecases. The below example playbooks can be created as `site-bin-isecl.yml`

> **Note:** If running behind a proxy, update the proxy variables under `vars/main.yml` and run as below

> **Note:** Go through the `Additional Examples and Tips` section for specific workflow samples

**Option 1**

```yaml
- hosts: all
  remote_user: root
  become: yes
  become_user: root
  gather_facts: yes
  any_errors_fatal: true
  vars:
    setup: <setup var from supported usecases>
    binaries_path: <path where built binaries are copied to>
  roles:   
  - ansible-role
  environment:
    http_proxy: "{{http_proxy}}"
    https_proxy: "{{https_proxy}}"
    no_proxy: "{{no_proxy}}"
```

and

```shell
ansible-playbook <playbook-name>
```

> **Note:** Update the `roles_path` under `ansible.cfg` to point to the cloned repository so that the role can be read by Ansible

OR

**Option 2:**

```yaml
- hosts: all
  remote_user: root
  become: yes
  become_user: root
  gather_facts: yes
  any_errors_fatal: true
  roles:   
  - ansible-role
  environment:
    http_proxy: "{{http_proxy}}"
    https_proxy: "{{https_proxy}}"
    no_proxy: "{{no_proxy}}"
```

and

```shell
ansible-playbook <playbook-name> --extra-vars setup=<setup var from supported usecases> --extra-vars binaries_path=<path where built binaries are copied to>
```

> **Note:** Update the `roles_path` under `ansible.cfg` to point to the cloned repository so that the role can be read by Ansible


### Additional Examples & Tips

* For `secure-key-caching` & `sgx-orchestration-kubernetes` usecase following options can be provided during runtime in the playbook for providing the PCS server key

  ```shell
   ansible-playbook <playbook-name> --extra-vars setup=<setup var from supported usecases> --extra-vars binaries_path=<path where built binaries are copied to> --extra-vars intel_provisioning_server_api_key=<pcs server key>
  ```

  or 

  Update the following vars in `defaults/main.yml`

  ```yaml
  intel_provisioning_server_api_key_sandbox: <pcs server key>
  ```

* If any service installation fails due to any misconfiguration, just uninstall the specific service manually , fix the misconfiguration in ansible and rerun the playbook. The successfully installed services wont be reinstalled.


### Usecase Setup Options

| Usecase                      | Variable                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Secure Key Caching           | `setup: secure-key-caching` in playbook or via `--extra-vars` as `setup=secure-key-caching`in CLI |
| SGX Orchestration Kubernetes | `setup: sgx-orchestration-kubernetes` in playbook or via `--extra-vars` as `setup=sgx-orchestration-kubernetes`in CLI |

> **Note:**  Orchestrator installation is not bundled with the role and need to be done independently. Also, components dependent on the orchestrator like `isecl-k8s-extensions` and `integration-hub` are installed either partially or not installed
## **9. Usecase Workflows with Postman API Collections**

The below allow to get started with workflows within Intel® SecL-DC for Foundational and Workload Security Usecases. More details available in [API Collections](https://github.com/intel-secl/utils/tree/v3.4/develop/tools/api-collections) repository

### Use Case Collections

| Use case                     | Sub-Usecase | API Collection     |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| Secure Key Caching           | -           | ✔️                  |
| SGX Discovery, Provisioning and Orchestration | -           | ✔️                  |

## **10. Deployment Using Binaries**

#### Setup K8S Cluster & Deploy Isecl-k8s-extensions

* Setup master and worker node for k8s. Worker node should be setup on SGX host machine. Master node can be any system.
* Please note whatever hostname has been used on worker node which pushes platform enablement info to SHVS from SGX Agent, use same node-name in join command.
* Once the master/worker setup is done, follow below steps:

##### Untar packages and load docker images
* Copy tar output isecl-k8s-extensions-*.tar.gz from build system's binaries folder to /opt/ directory on the Master Node and extract the contents.
```
    cd /opt/
    tar -xvzf isecl-k8s-extensions-*.tar.gz
```
* Load the docker images
```
    cd isecl-k8s-extensions
    docker load -i docker-isecl-controller-v*.tar
    docker load -i docker-isecl-scheduler-v*.tar
```

##### Deploy isecl-controller
* Create hostattributes.crd.isecl.intel.com crd
```
    kubectl apply -f yamls/crd-1.17.yaml
```
* Check whether the crd is created
```
    kubectl get crds
```
* Deploy isecl-controller
```
    kubectl apply -f yamls/isecl-controller.yaml
```
* Check whether the isecl-controller is up and running
```
    kubectl get deploy -n isecl
```
* Create clusterrolebinding for ihub to get access to cluster nodes
```
    kubectl create clusterrolebinding isecl-clusterrole --clusterrole=system:node --user=system:serviceaccount:isecl:isecl
```
* Fetch token required for ihub installation and follow below IHUB installation steps,
```
    kubectl get secrets -n isecl
    kubectl describe secret default-token-<name> -n isecl
```

For IHUB installation, make sure to update below configuration in /root/binaries/env/ihub.env before installing ihub on CSP system:
* Copy /etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.crt from master node to /root on CSP system. Update KUBERNETES_CERT_FILE.
* Get k8s token in master, using above commands and update KUBERNETES_TOKEN
* Update the value of CRD name
```
	KUBERNETES_CRD=custom-isecl-sgx
```

##### Deploy isecl-scheduler
* The isecl-scheduler default configuration is provided for common cluster support in /opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/yamls/isecl-scheduler.yaml. Variables HVS_IHUB_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH and SGX_IHUB_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH are by default set to default paths. Please use and set only required variables based on the use case. 
For example, if only sgx based attestation is required then remove/comment HVS_IHUB_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH variables.

* Install cfssl and cfssljson on Kubernetes Control Plane
```
    #Download cfssl to /usr/local/bin/
    wget -O /usr/local/bin/cfssl http://pkg.cfssl.org/R1.2/cfssl_linux-amd64
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cfssl

    #Download cfssljson to /usr/local/bin
    wget -O /usr/local/bin/cfssljson http://pkg.cfssl.org/R1.2/cfssljson_linux-amd64
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cfssljson
```

* Create tls key pair for isecl-scheduler service, which is signed by k8s apiserver.crt
```
    cd /opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/
    chmod +x create_k8s_extsched_cert.sh
    ./create_k8s_extsched_cert.sh -n "K8S Extended Scheduler" -s "<K8_MASTER_IP>","<K8_MASTER_HOST>" -c /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt -k /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.key
```
* After iHub deployment, copy /etc/ihub/ihub_public_key.pem from ihub to /opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/ directory on k8 master system. Also, copy tls key pair generated in previous step to secrets directory.
```
    mkdir secrets
    cp /opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/server.key secrets/
    cp /opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/server.crt secrets/
    mv /opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/ihub_public_key.pem /opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/sgx_ihub_public_key.pem
    cp /opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/sgx_ihub_public_key.pem secrets/
```
Note: Prefix the attestation type for ihub_public_key.pem before copying to secrets folder.
* Create kubernetes secrets scheduler-secret for isecl-scheduler
```
    kubectl create secret generic scheduler-certs --namespace isecl --from-file=secrets
```
* Deploy isecl-scheduler
```
    kubectl apply -f yamls/isecl-scheduler.yaml
```
* Check whether the isecl-scheduler is up and running
```
    kubectl get deploy -n isecl
```

##### Configure kube-scheduler to establish communication with isecl-scheduler
* Add scheduler-policy.json under kube-scheduler section, mountPath under container section and hostPath under volumes section in /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml as mentioned below
```
spec:
  containers:
  - command:
    - kube-scheduler
    - --policy-config-file=/opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/scheduler-policy.json
```

```
  containers:
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/
      name: extendedsched
      readOnly: true
```

```
  volumes:
  - hostPath:
      path: /opt/isecl-k8s-extensions/
      type:
    name: extendedsched
```

Note: Make sure to use proper indentation and don't delete existing mountPath and hostPath sections in kube-scheduler.yaml.
* Restart Kubelet which restart all the k8s services including kube base schedular
```
	systemctl restart kubelet
```

* Check if CRD data is populated
```
	kubectl get -o json hostattributes.crd.isecl.intel.com
```

## **11. System User Configuration**

**Build System**

**Setup ~/.gitconfig to update the git user details. A sample config is provided below**

GIT Configuration**

```
[user]
        name = John Doe
        email = john.doe@abc.com
[color]
        ui = auto
 [push]
        default = matching 
```

* Make sure system date and time of SGX machine and CSP machine both are in sync. Also, if the system is configured to read the RTC time in the local time zone, then use RTC in UTC by running `timedatectl set-local-rtc 0` command on both the machine. Otherwise SGX Agent deployment will fail with certificate expiry error. 
    
## Appendix

### Creating RSA Keys in Key Broker Service

**Configuration Update to create Keys in KBS**

	cd into /root/binaries/kbs_script folder
	
	Update SYSTEM_IP address in run.sh (where AAS and KBS are deployed)
	
	Update CACERT_PATH variable with trustedca certificate (/etc/kbs/certs/trustedca/<id.pem>)

**Create RSA Key**

	Execute the command
	
	./run.sh reg

- copy the generated cert file to SGX Compute node where skc_library is deployed. Also make a note of the key id generated

### Configuration for NGINX testing

**Note:** Below mentioned OpenSSL and NGINX configuration updates are provided as patches (nginx.patch and openssl.patch) as part of skc_library deployment script.

**OpenSSL**

In the /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf file, look for the below line:
[ new_oids ]

Just before the line [ new_oids ], add the below section:

openssl_conf = openssl_def

[openssl_def]
engines = engine_section
oid_section = new_oids

[engine_section]
pkcs11 = pkcs11_section

[pkcs11_section]
engine_id = pkcs11
dynamic_path =/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/engines-1.1/pkcs11.so
MODULE_PATH =/opt/skc/lib/libpkcs11-api.so
init = 0

**Nginx**

Update nginx configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf with below changes:

ssl_engine pkcs11;

Update the location of certificate with the loaction where it was copied into the skc_library machine. 

ssl_certificate "add absolute path of crt file";

Update the KeyID with the KeyID received when RSA key was generated in KBS

ssl_certificate_key "engine:pkcs11:pkcs11:token=KMS;id=164b41ae-be61-4c7c-a027-4a2ab1e5e4c4;object=RSAKEY;type=private;pin-value=1234";

**SKC Configuration**

 Create keys.txt in /root folder. This provides key preloading functionality in skc_library.

  Any number of keys can be added in keys.txt. Each PKCS11 URL should contain different Key ID which need to be transferred from KBS along with respective object tag for each key id specified

  Sample PKCS11 url is as below
  
  pkcs11:token=KMS;id=164b41ae-be61-4c7c-a027-4a2ab1e5e4c4;object=RSAKEY;type=private;pin-value=1234;
  
  Last PKCS11 url entry in keys.txt should match with the one in nginx.conf

  The keyID should match the keyID of RSA key created in KBS. Other contents should match with nginx.conf. File location should match with preload_keys directive in pkcs11-apimodule.ini; 

  Sample /opt/skc/etc/pkcs11-apimodule.ini file
	
	[core]
	preload_keys=/root/keys.txt
	keyagent_conf=/opt/skc/etc/key-agent.ini
	mode=SGX

### KBS key-transfer flow validation

On SGX Compute node, Execute below commands for KBS key-transfer:

```
    pkill nginx
```

Remove any existing pkcs11 token

```
    rm -rf /opt/intel/cryptoapitoolkit/tokens/*
```

Initiate Key transfer from KBS

```
    systemctl restart nginx
```

Establish a tls session with the nginx using the key transferred inside the enclave

```
    wget https://localhost:2443 --no-check-certificate
```

# Note on Key Transfer Policy

Key transfer policy is used to enforce a set of policies which need to be compiled with before the secret can be securely provisioned onto a sgx enclave

A typical Key Transfer Policy would look as below
```
        "sgx_enclave_issuer_anyof":["cd171c56941c6ce49690b455f691d9c8a04c2e43e0a4d30f752fa5285c7ee57f"],
        "sgx_enclave_issuer_product_id_anyof":[0],
        "sgx_enclave_measurement_anyof":["7df0b7e815bd4b4af41239038d04a740daccf0beb412a2056c8d900b45b621fd"],
        "tls_client_certificate_issuer_cn_anyof":["CMSCA", "CMS TLS Client CA"],
        "client_permissions_allof":["nginx","USA"],
        "sgx_enforce_tcb_up_to_date":false
```

sgx_enclave_issuer_anyof establishes the signing identity provided by an authority who has signed the sgx enclave. in other words the owner of the enclave

sgx_enclave_measurement_anyof represents the cryptographic hash of the enclave log (enclave code, data)

sgx_enforce_tcb_up_to_date - If set to true, Key Broker service will provision the key only of the platform generating the quote conforms to the latest Trusted Computing Base

client_permissions_allof - Special permission embedded into the skc_library client TLS certificate which can enforce additional restrictons on who can get access to the key,
    In above example: the key is provisioned only to the nginx workload and platform which is tagged with value for ex: USA
